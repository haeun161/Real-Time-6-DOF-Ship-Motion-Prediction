# Real-Time-6-DOF-Ship-Motion-Prediction

**Generalization and Comparative Evaluation of RNN-Based Deep Learning Models for Real-Time 6-DOF Ship Motion Prediction**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of the paper:  
**"Generalization and Comparative Evaluation of RNN-Based Deep Learning Models for Real-Time 6-DOF Ship Motion Prediction."**

The project evaluates the generalization performance of various RNN-based deep learning models for multivariate time-series prediction of ship motion with six degrees of freedom (6-DOF).

## ðŸ§  Models

The following RNN-based models are implemented and compared:

- Vanilla RNN  
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)  
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)  
- Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)  

All model definitions are located in [`models/models.py`](models/models.py).
